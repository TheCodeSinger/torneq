  <h1>Chain Prep</h1>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
    <p>Chain will start on <strong>Sunday</strong> at 20:00 TCT, which is 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern, 9pm London.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>WE NEED EVERYONE</strong> if we are to reach 2500 attacks.</p>
    <p><strong>Start stacking Xanax Friday night</strong>&nbsp;to ensure you've stacked four Xanax prior to the chain. You need to do this early enough that your drug cool down is gone so you can take a fifth Xanax during the chain. The faction armory has Xanax which is free to use for chain prep.</p>
    <p><strong>No attacking on Saturday or Sunday until the chain</strong>. If we see you attack, then we know you either are not stacking Xanax or you are wasting energy that should be spent on the chain. Your missions can wait until during or after the chain.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This Sunday at 20:00 TCT</strong>&nbsp;we will start a big chain, and we are shooting for 2500. To do this,&nbsp;<strong>WE NEED EVERYONE</strong>&nbsp;to contribute as many attacks as they can. If 75 members contribute 34 attacks, we're golden. Realistically, many of us will contribute 62 attacks or more (see guide below), which lowers the burden for the rest of the faction. If the timing is difficult, then pop in when you can and contribute as best you can. If you can only give us 1 attack, please do it. That might be the difference.</p>
    <p>If everyone actually joined at the appointed time, the chain could be completed in one hour. But that is not realistic because not everyone is available to join at the same time. For that reason, we need "<strong>chain watchers</strong>" who withhold their attacks.. only attacking when the 5min interval timer gets low. This will keep the chain alive for hours while we wait for others to join. If you are free for multiple hours, then let someone else watch the first hour and you can wait for a later hour.</p>
    <p><strong>Optimal Plan</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Starting 36-48 hours prior to when you plan to join the chain, begin stacking 4 Xanax (each ~7 hours apart).
        <ul>
          <li>Start with zero energy so you don't waste energy.</li>
          <li>Use Xanax from the faction armory if you need it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        After your 4th Xanax, immediately fly to Switzerland
        <ul>
          <li>Only if lvl 15+. Another reason for you to power ahead to lvl 15.</li>
          <li>Bring $1m with you to rehab which removes addiction effects (-35% to battle stats)</li>
          <li>Then return to Torn before the chain.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When the time comes, use all 40 attacks.
        <ul>
          <li>"Leave on the street." Period.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not mug</strong> because it yields less respect.</li>
          <li>Do not hospitalize because you want that target available again in 20 mins.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use points to refill your energy (another 150e) and attack 6 times.</li>
      <li>
        Use the free energy (250e) in your Torn City Newsletter emailed quarterly
        <ul>
          <li>If you cannot find this email, go to your settings and click the "Resend Seasonal Newsletter":&nbsp;<a href="https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=email-subscriptions">https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=email-subscriptions</a></li>
          <li>Near the bottom of&nbsp;the email message is a button to "Claim 250 energy". Click it and then attack 10 more times!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a fifth Xanax (another 250e) and attack 10 more times.
        <ul>
          <li>Do this only <strong>after</strong> youâ€™ve used up all previous energy because you may OD and lose that energy.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a new day has dawned, then you can do a second point refill (another 150e). Wheee!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do all of this, you will have attacked 72 times!!!</p>
    <p>If you are willing to spend the money, feel free to use energy drinks, Feathery Hotel Coupons, company specials, etc. But if you've already given us 72 attacks, you've done very well. And the faction is better for it. Thank you!!</p>
    <p>Metal wrote a comprehensive guide and posted it in our faction forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&amp;f=999&amp;t=16086326&amp;b=1&amp;a=9524">https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&amp;f=999&amp;t=16086326&amp;b=1&amp;a=9524</a></p>
    <p>Some of you will&nbsp;OD during the stacking process. This is reality. If this happens to you, notify the faction on chat or Discord so we can help you. If you can fly to rehab, bring $1m and do it immediately. Then start over and stack as many Xanax as you can until the chain.</p>
